Hi, I'm Meko. You can simply call me Meko or Meko Chan. I'm an indie developer and an art enthusiast.

I'm about to pursue my CS Master's degree this September in Hangzhou, China.

I love trying out new things and learning new skills. I want to establish my own indie game studio one day.

Currently, I'm working on iOS development, but I also dabble in other areas as well.

I would like to meet like-minded new friends. If you also enjoy independent development and art, feel free to contact me. We can do interesting things and embark on exciting endeavors together!
